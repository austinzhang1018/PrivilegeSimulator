NoPromotion.jpg
You have not received any type of significant promotion or pay raise in your current job. Whether it was a lack of motivation or an unfavorable boss, you just couldnâ€™t seem to gain traction on elevating your career. As a result, your salary and socioeconomic class will remain the same, and there will be no upward economic mobility for you in the future.
