Congratulations. You finish the simulator in the upper class where you make a six figure salary. However, it is not necessarily because of any special work ethic or commitment you demonstrated. Growing up rich, you naturally had more oppurtunites than others. Your family was in this same class growing up, so you have simply just continued the trend. You did not disappoint by any standard, but you did not do anything extraordinary either.
