TSA.jpg
After working for many decades, you are finally ready to retire. The first thing you do is take a vacation. You book a flight and prepare to relax. When you get to the airport though, it becomes clear you arenâ€™t going to be enjoying retirement quite so soon. What should be a normal TSA checkpoint becomes something much more complicated, as you are asked to step aside and then later brought in for questioning. You are 100% innocent, but for some reason the TSA believes you have done something wrong.
